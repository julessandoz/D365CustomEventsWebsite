# Customizing Dynamics 365's Events Portal

As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I'm working with [Silicom Group](https://silicom.group) to help them customize the Events Portal offered by Dynamics 365's Marketing Module more easily and efficiently.

In this repo, I will be storing all my coding progress through the whole project.

## Changes to be made

All along the project, I will be implementing multiple changes to the portal: Here's a non-exhaustive list:
* Updating the general design such as: 
    * The colors
    * The fonts
* Updating the look of the events list
* Adding the possibility to redirect to another website when clicking an event in the list
* Adding the possibility to use private events
* Adding the possibility to use categories
* Adding filters to the events list

## Pull requests
As this is a Bachelor's thesis, external collaborations will not be accepted until at least September '23.
